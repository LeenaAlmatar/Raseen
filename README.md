# Raseen
We developed our application using the CBL framework. We came up with an idea and solution, then moved on to lo-fi and hi-fi sketching. Then we started developing our application, and lastly, we presented and demoed our application. In the past few weeks, I had the pleasure of creating “Raseen” with my great teammates Revan Nasser, Noura Almudaires, Samah Alkunaydiri, and Shahad Kamli.

Raseen’s goal is to help preserve valuable Saudi linguistic and cultural knowledge that might be at risk of fading away over time due to the influence of globalized communication and media. Also, it breaks the language barrier between Saudis who speak different dialects.
